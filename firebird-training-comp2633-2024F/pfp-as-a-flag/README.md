# PFP-as-a-Flag

## Description

Did you know that, since the very beginning of COMP2633 this semester, the challenge author has stored a flag in his profile picture using the state-of-the-art flag storage algorithm called Local Storage Blocks?

And the author manages to compress the flag into very very small dots using a hydraulic press... Maybe you want to unpress it to see the flag?
