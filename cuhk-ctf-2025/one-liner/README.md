# One-liner

## Summary

## Description

Most CTF challenges in the rev category are about decompiling binaries. As a crypto player, the challenge author does not like cracking binaries. He is also tired of reading long long codes.

What's more fun than a rev challenge with the whole code given and containing only 1 line of code?
