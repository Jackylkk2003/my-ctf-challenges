# My CTF Challenges

This repository contains a collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges that I have created. Each challenge is organized into its own directory with relevant files.

Some files may be redacted/modified due to various reasons (such as writeups for ongoing challenges).

## Directory Structure
- `competition_name/`: Contains the competition/scenario of the challenges.
  - `challenge_name/`: Contains files related to a specific challenge.
    - `README.md`: A brief description of the challenge.
    - `env/`: Docker environment setup files (if applicable).
    - `files/`: Files provided for the challenge (if any).
    - `src/`: Any files related to the challenge, such as source code for reverse engineering challenges, solve scripts, and writeups.

## Categories
The challenges span various categories including:
- web (web exploitation)
- pwn (binary exploitation)
- crypto (cryptography)
- forens (forensics)
- rev (reverse engineering)
- misc (miscellaneous)

## Writeups
The writeups/solutions of these challenges are available in the `src/` directory of the respective challenges.
