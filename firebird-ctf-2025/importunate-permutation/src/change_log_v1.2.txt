Implemented whole service using Python because I like big ints
Removed the restriction that the private keys are at most 10000000 by removing the modulo

Optimized the service, now it runs much faster :>
Changed the random number generator to a cryptographically secure one
Uploaded the previously missing flag file :P
This system is now given a good name: Importunate Permutation Service!!!
