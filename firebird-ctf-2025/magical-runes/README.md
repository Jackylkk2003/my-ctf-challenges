## Description

Crafted by the most powerful sorcerer, the Grimoire of Runes encodes the wild secret of ancient wisdom. Considering the ultimate power of this greatest tome in history, people have been cauciously protecting the Grimoire for centuries, preventing the vast knowledge from falling into the wrong hands. It has been so well protected that no one knows how to decode the runes now. At least no one has been able to exploit the Grimoire, right?

Let's go back in time and see what happened when the almighty sorcerer, Firebird Chan, created the Grimoire of Runes. As a wise philosopher and magician and master of the arcane world, Firebird Chan has seen through the future and expected that the wisdom will be lost in time. To prevent the loss of knowledge, Firebird Chan recorded part of the process of creating the Grimoire and encoded it in a format that no one understands at that time (aka computer program).

Maybe it is now time for you to recover the great ancient arcane knowledge hidden within the wild runes?
